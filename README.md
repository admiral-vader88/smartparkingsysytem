# Smart Parking System Using Arduino
### Smart Parking System Using Arduino and Ultrasonic Sensor

#### Introduction
This note describes a simplified smart parking system designed using an Arduino board, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and a servo motor. The system detects the presence of a vehicle within a specific range and automatically controls a barrier arm to allow or deny access to a parking area.

#### System Components
- **Arduino Board**: Acts as the central processing unit for controlling other components.
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**: Detects the distance of objects in front of it, used here to identify the presence of a car.
- **Servo Motor**: Manages the lifting and lowering of the barrier arm, attached to the servo.
- **Barrier Arm**: Attached to the servo, this arm lifts when a car is detected and lowers when the area is clear.

#### Operation
1. **Setup**: The servo motor is attached to pin 13 of the Arduino, initialized to point at 180 degrees, which indicates a lowered barrier position. The ultrasonic sensor's trig and echo pins are connected to pins 11 and 12, respectively.

2. **Distance Measurement**: The ultrasonic sensor sends out a pulse. By measuring how long it takes for the echo to return, the distance to the nearest object is calculated. This is done continuously in the loop.

3. **Barrier Control**: 
   - If a car comes within 25 cm of the sensor, the servo is triggered to rotate to 180 degrees, lifting the barrier arm and allowing the car to pass.
   - If no object is detected within this range, the servo moves to 90 degrees, lowering the barrier to block entry.

4. **Feedback**: Distance readings are sent to the serial monitor, providing real-time feedback on the proximity of objects to the sensor.

#### Applications
This basic setup is ideally suited for small-scale applications like controlling access to private parking areas in residential buildings or small commercial complexes. It ensures that only vehicles close enough to the sensor (i.e., at the gate) trigger the opening of the barrier.

#### Expansion Ideas
- **Multiple Sensors**: Use more sensors for a more robust system that can handle multiple lanes or directions.
- **Connectivity**: Add wireless communication to allow remote monitoring and control.
- **Authentication**: Integrate RFID or license plate recognition for enhanced security.

#### Conclusion
This smart parking system demonstrates how simple components can be used to create functional and automated solutions to everyday problems. By adjusting the parameters and expanding the hardware setup, it can be adapted to a wide range of applications.
